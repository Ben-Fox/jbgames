## Corrections Needed

### Q25 — White Christmas in NYC
- **Game says:** About 22%
- **Actual:** About 12% (CBS News/NOAA data says 13%; FOX 5 meteorologist says 11%)
- **Source:** CBS News (Dec 2025), FOX 5 NY (Dec 2025)
- **Fix:** Change 22% → 12%

### Q50 — High school football player making NFL
- **Game says:** About 0.08% with "about 250 get drafted each year" from "roughly 1 million" HS players
- **Actual:** ~0.02-0.03%. NFL drafts ~256 players/year from ~1 million HS players = 0.026%. Even including UDFAs who make rosters (~350 total), it's ~0.035%.
- **Source:** Ohio State analysis; NCAA data
- **Fix:** Change 0.08% → 0.03%, update fact text

### Q80 — Sharing birthday with US president / "No president born in June"
- **Game says:** "No president has ever been born in June!"
- **Actual:** George H.W. Bush was born June 12, 1924. He was the first president born in June.
- **Source:** potus.com, multiple presidential fact sites
- **Fix:** Remove the false June claim

### Q93 — Spider swallowing myth origin
- **Game says:** "fabricated in 1993 to show how easily fake facts spread on the internet"
- **Actual:** The "Lisa Holst 1993 magazine column" origin story (from Snopes) is itself disputed — Mental Floss found no evidence Lisa Holst or the magazine "PC Professional" ever existed. The myth's true origin is unknown.
- **Source:** Mental Floss (2013)
- **Fix:** Remove the specific 1993 claim, keep the myth-debunking

### Q97 — Penny landing on edge
- **Game says:** "an American penny can land on its edge about 1 in 6,000 times" per physicist Daniel Murray
- **Actual:** The 1 in 6,000 figure is for an American **nickel**, not a penny (per Wikipedia's coin flipping article, citing Murray & Teare's computational model). Pennies are thinner and would have lower odds.
- **Source:** Wikipedia "Coin flipping"; Murray & Teare paper
- **Fix:** Change "penny" to "nickel" in the fact text, or note the distinction

### Q9 — IRS audit rate
- **Game says:** About 1 in 250
- **Actual:** Overall audit rate has dropped to ~0.2% (about 1 in 500) as of recent IRS data. The fact text saying "1 in 500 for under $200K" is now roughly the overall rate.
- **Source:** IRS Data Book; Congress.gov CRS report (0.29% for 2019 returns)
- **Fix:** Change to 1 in 500, update fact text

## Borderline / Minor Notes (NOT fixed — close enough for casual trivia)

- **Q8 (Pearl in oyster):** Game says 1 in 12,000; one source says 1 in 10,000. Close enough.
- **Q26 (Meteorite hit):** Game says 1 in 250,000; Nat Geo cites 1 in 1,600,000 for *dying* from one. "Being hit" vs "dying" are different metrics. Acceptable.
- **Q13 (Extra finger):** Game says 1 in 500; medical literature says 0.37-1.2 per 1,000 (1 in 833 to 1 in 2,700 for Caucasians, much higher in African populations). The 1 in 500 is on the high side but within range depending on population.
- **Q36 (No-hitter %):** Game says 0.08% per game. With ~326 no-hitters across ~300K+ MLB games, actual rate is ~0.1%. Close enough.
- **Q44 (Bestselling novel):** Game says 1 in 220 among published books. Hard to verify precisely; depends on definitions.
- **Q75 (Email spam):** Game frames it as "your email ending up in spam" at 45%. Global spam percentage has been declining from 45-48% range. Acceptable framing.
