# 🧠 BrainSmacks — TODO / Checklist

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy (merge dev → main)
- [ ] SEO meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter cards (all pages)
- [ ] sitemap.xml + robots.txt
- [ ] "Heavy Eye" rename (was HeavyEye)
- [ ] Likelihood card on landing page
- [ ] Landing page logo (bitten computer + BrainSmacks text)
- [ ] Removed "No ads" from subtitle
- [ ] Home button (🏠) on all games
- [ ] BreakPoint help/home button repositioned + responsive rules modal
- [ ] Heavy Eye scale pivot fix
- [ ] Heavy Eye Round 1 matchup fix (removing absurd ratios)

## 🔧 In Progress
- [ ] Heavy Eye — Round 1 data rebalancing (sub-agent working)
- [ ] Tree Fall — cutting mechanic still broken (back burner per Josh)

## 🎮 Games to Refine
- [ ] Catastrophe — playtest full v2 + dog mechanic
- [ ] Shatterform — playtesting needed
- [ ] BreakPoint — Sacrifice mechanic (replace auto-regen)
- [ ] Light vs Dark — Josh playtesting, more feedback expected
- [ ] Fill Or Spill — needs review
- [ ] ZoomOut — could show category from start
- [ ] Magnitude — needs review
- [ ] Holdfast — unknown status, needs review

## 🌐 Website / SEO
- [ ] Merge dev → main so sitemap goes live
- [ ] Resubmit sitemap in Google Search Console after merge
- [ ] Google Search Console — verify indexing after a few days
- [ ] Add game cards to landing page for remaining games (Catastrophe, Shatterform, etc.)
- [ ] AdSense setup (when ready for ads)

## 💡 Ideas / Future
- [ ] SplitLine game (not yet built)
- [ ] EyeballIt game (not yet built)
- [ ] HueGuess game (not yet built)
- [ ] Share on Reddit (r/webgames, r/indiegames) for traffic
- [ ] Post on itch.io
- [ ] OG images (actual screenshots for social previews)
- [ ] Systemd services for game servers (survive reboots)
- [ ] LLC formation if Ben/Josh want to formalize
